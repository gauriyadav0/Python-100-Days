# Day 002 - My Python Story
Welcome to Day 2 of my 100 days of code journey! Let me start with a story.

In college, I dove deep into C and C++ programming. I scored good marks and created numerous programs involving printing, conditionals, and loops. However, I wanted to take my skills further and make them more beneficial.

In my second year of college, I began working in the industry with Python. Initially, I wasn't very proficient with it, but I still managed to write code for a Singaporean client and make decent money without mastering Python entirely. I soon ventured into web scraping and found it to be a lucrative endeavor. I made good money on Fiverr by writing Python programs to automate web scraping, charging on a per webpage basis.

Later on, I learned Flask and got the opportunity to work with a university professor abroad. Long story short, Python has had a significant impact on my career.

## What Can Python Do for You?

I want to show you some Python programs I created that will surely inspire you to create your own versions as we progress through this tutorial. If you're a beginner and just started working on Python, don't try to recreate them just yet. We will make progress gradually, so trust me. 

Even though I sound like a college graduate, I am currently still a student. Let's embark on this journey together and see how Python can transform your skills and career!
